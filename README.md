# Data-Science-take-home-chanllenge
Python solutions to various challenging data science problems, starting from the book "a collection of data science take-home challenges" written by Giulio Palombo.
The objective of this project is to practice Python coding skills and solve some real world data science problems. 

Also, as my first Github project, this also helps me learn to build a project using the world's most popular software management platform.
